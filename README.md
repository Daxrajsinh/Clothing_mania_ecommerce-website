# Clothing_mania_ecommerce-website
An e-Commerce Website built using Python and Django-Framework.

“CLOTHING MANIA”, our e-commerce websites allow users to buy an exciting range of clothing products online. We’ve used Django, a popular web framework written in Python that provides a robust set of tools for building web applications, including e-commerce websites.

Here are some key features of our Django-based e-commerce website:

Product catalog: Django's object-relational mapper (ORM) makes it easy to create and manage a database of products. We have defined product categories, tags, images, and other metadata, and displayed them in a user-friendly interface.

Shopping cart: A shopping cart allows users to add items to their order, view their order total, and proceed to checkout. Django's session framework is used to store the user's cart between requests.

Search and filtering: Users should be able to find products quickly and easily. Django's built-in search functionality and third-party libraries like django-filter is used with the HTML search button in the navigation menu to provide powerful search and filtering capabilities.

Checkout process: The checkout process typically involves collecting the user's shipping and billing information, verifying the order details, and processing the payment. We have simply used HTML forms here to build a secure checkout process and for payment.

Order management: Once an order is placed, it needs to be tracked and fulfilled. Django's admin interface is used to provide an order management system that integrates with your fulfillment process (admin can put a tick mark on Order status which means order requested is placed).
